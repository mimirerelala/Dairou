Letterpress Game Rules
Its important to note a few basic rules.

1. Using an opponent's tile gives you one point and takes away one point from your opponent. These tiles will also change in colour to your side's colour.
2. If coloured is surrounded on all 4 sides by tiles of similar colour, it will become a darker colour. If you use this tile, you will receive no points.
3. When dark coloured tiles are used, they remain a dark colour (they do not change to your side's colour).
4. If you use letter tiles from around a darker coloured tile, it will return it to a lighter colour.
5. Each game has a limited number of vowels that can be used
6. The game ends when all the tiles are used. The winner is the player with more points than the other.
